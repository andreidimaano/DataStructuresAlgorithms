<h1>K Closest Points to Origin</h1>

<a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/">Leet Code Link</a>

We have a list of points on the plane.  Find the K closest points to the origin (0, 0).

(Here, the distance between two points on a plane is the Euclidean distance.)

You may return the answer in any order.  The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in.)
