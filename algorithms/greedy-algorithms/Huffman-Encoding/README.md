# Huffman Encoding

### Problem Set Up
1. Explain Huffman Encoding - what do we use it for?
2. What are the inputs and outputs to Huffman Encoding? 
3. What are prefix codes? How are prefix codes used in Huffman Tree Encoding?
4. What is a full binary tree? Why do we use full binary trees in Encoding? How does full binary trees relate to the amount of leaves we will have and the amount of internal nodes we will have?
5. Given a tree T corresponding to a prefix code, How do you compute the bits required to encode a file?
6. Knowing the amount of internal nodes, How many times do we need to merge two objects to build a tree?
7. What is the cost of creating a map of characters and frequencies from a text of length n? What data structure would you use?
8. What is the cost of each heap operation? 
9. What is the cost of creating a min heap?
10. On a text of length n and k distinct characters, what is the running time of the Huffman Tree Algorithm? 
11. 

### Greedy Choice Property
1. What is the greedy choice property?
2. What are we trying to prove?
3. What assumptions do we make about the freq of the greedy choices and the freq of the optimal solution.
4. Show that B(T) - B(T') is greater or equal to 0.
5. Show that B(T') - B(T'') is greater or equal to 0.
6. What does this show?
7. Why is this a greedy choice? 

### Optimal Substructure
1. What is the substructure?
2.
